BOOTSTRAP 4

- In Bootstrap 4 they moved from LESS to SASS (CSS)

- Bootstrap4 focus on GRID system with flexbox (CSS)

- CDN => COntent Delivery Network => if you want to call the bootstrap files from there without download them, you want to use the Integrity attribute as per mention it inside the bootstrp website (it check for the elements that coming from the third party same CDN service to be sure that nobody make the injection for the code that you want it so it protects you)
